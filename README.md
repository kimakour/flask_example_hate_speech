# flask_example_hate_speech
A repository containing an example of using the Flask framework to deploy a Machine Learning model in a web application.
The model used is just for the sake of demonstration. It is a logistic regression on top of TFIDF transformation over 1000 dimensions(nothing really great for such a task). 
So the idea here is to use the flask framework and not to have a great model to predict hate speech. If you are interested in such a task, contact me !
